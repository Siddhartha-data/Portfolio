# About Me
Hi, I’m **Siddhartha Saini**, a passionate and curious **Data Science** enthusiast with a strong foundation in **data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. I love turning raw data into meaningful insights that solve real-world problems.**

Currently pursuing my studies in **Data Science**, I’ve worked on various hands-on projects ranging from **stock market prediction and IMDb sentiment analysis to Power BI dashboards and SQL-based learning platforms. I’m also exploring areas like Explainable AI**.

I believe in continuous learning and love building innovative solutions that blend data with impact. When I’m not coding or visualizing, you might find me brainstorming new ideas, researching futuristic tech, or helping others grow in the data field.
